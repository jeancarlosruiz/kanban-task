## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

#### Backend:

- [Turso](https://turso.tech/) - SQLite for production database.
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) - ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- [Authjs](https://authjs.dev) - Authentication for the Web.
- [Next.js Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) - Handle server-side logic, such as fetching data and updating databases.

#### Frontend:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) - For UI Components
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion) - For animations.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - For forms validations

#### Testing:

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - End-to-end testing for modern web apps.

### What I learned

Iâ€™ve learned a lot about Next.js at an intermediate level, with my biggest takeaways being how to handle authentication with Auth.js, create a Drizzle schema with SQLite, manage databases with Turso, and run basic tests using Playwright.
